MPC19: Job Salary Prediction Project
This project focuses on predicting salaries for data science jobs based on various features such as location, experience, education, skills, and company characteristics. We will conduct a comprehensive data analysis and build predictive models to evaluate and recommend the best model for salary prediction.

Project Tasks
Data Analysis:

Explore and visualize the dataset to understand the distribution and relationships between different features.
Clean and preprocess the data as necessary, handling missing values and converting categorical variables into numerical format for modeling.
Model Building:

Implement predictive models such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting.
Utilize features such as location, experience level, employment type, remote work ratio, and company characteristics to predict salaries.
Performance Evaluation:

Evaluate models using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2).
Compare and analyze the performance of each model to identify the best-performing model for salary prediction.
Recommendations:

Recommend the best model based on evaluation results and provide insights into factors influencing salary predictions.
Discuss potential limitations and future improvements for enhancing salary prediction accuracy.
